# Common mistakes

These are valid-against-schema-but-broken patterns that this tool deliberately catches early via strict validation, lint, or runtime renderer behavior.

## Workflow mistakes

### Reading the rendered .html file

Reports embed the renderer + bundled JS (mermaid, JSONLogic, the dispatcher). Total ~3 MB. **Reading the file with `Read` / `cat` / `head` overflows agent context** and corrupts the conversation.

To recover the source JSON from a rendered file:
```bash
llm-report-html extract out.html -o doc.json
```
This pulls only the data slot (~10 KB) — the bundle stays unread.

### Editing the rendered HTML directly

Don't try to "patch" a string in the .html. Always `extract → edit JSON → render`.

### Adding fields not in the schema

The schema is `additionalProperties: false`. The validator rejects any field not in the per-surface `$defs`. Workaround attempts (e.g., adding a `note: "…"` next to `text:`) fail validation; do not bypass — the renderer will produce worse output on rejected data.

### Trying to write inline JS or `<script>` tags

This tool deliberately bounds expressiveness:
- For computation: use cells + JSONLogic + curated operators (`schema --operators`).
- For new visual elements: choose from existing surfaces; don't invent.

If those don't suffice, the request likely doesn't fit this tool — it wants a different deliverable.

### Empty-text callout used as a colored section heading

`callout` is a **labeled boxed message**. Its body lives in the `text` field (markdown — bullet lists, paragraphs, bold, etc. all work inside). It is NOT a "colored heading widget".

Anti-pattern (passes validation but renders visually broken — content escapes the callout box):

```json
{"type": "callout", "kind": "success", "title": "功绩", "text": ""},
{"type": "list",    "items": [...]}
```

The sibling `list` renders **outside** the callout's bordered container — orphaned bullets below an empty colored bar.

Correct patterns:
- Put bullets inside the callout's `text` as markdown: `"text": "- item 1\n- item 2\n- item 3"`.
- For a "pros vs cons" comparison, use `columns` of two callouts, each with bullets in its own `text`.
- If you only want a tinted section header without a body, use a normal `heading` — don't co-opt callout.

### Mermaid: validate before committing to JSON

Schema can only assert that `code` is a non-empty string — it cannot parse mermaid syntax. A diagram with nested unescaped `"` inside `["..."]` node labels, unclosed brackets, or other syntax errors **passes `validate` but breaks at browser render time** (you'll see `<div class="report-error">` instead of the diagram).

**Always pre-flight mermaid through the skill's validator before placing it into a `section.mermaid` block:**

```bash
# stdin
echo 'flowchart LR
A[Start] --> B[End]' | .claude/skills/llm-report-html/scripts/validate-mermaid.sh

# argument form
.claude/skills/llm-report-html/scripts/validate-mermaid.sh "$(cat my-diagram.mmd)"
```

Exit 0 = OK. Exit 1 = parse error printed to stderr; rewrite the diagram (or drop it — this surface is optional) before continuing. First invocation auto-installs `mermaid` + `jsdom` into `scripts/node_modules/` (~30 MB, one-time).

Common LLM-induced mermaid mistakes the validator catches:
- Nested `"` inside node labels: `["{type: "x"}"]` — escape with `&quot;` or replace with `'`.
- Unclosed `[`, `{`, `(`.
- Reserved keywords used as node IDs.

## Lint warnings (also auto-detected)

Lint is run as part of `validate`; pass `--strict` to make warnings fatal.

- **unused-cell** — declared in `state` or `computed` but never read by any section
- **undeclared-cell** — `{$bind:X}` or `input.bind` references a cell that doesn't exist in `state` or `computed`
- **cycle** — computed cell A depends on B which depends on A (renderer can't break the loop)
- **trivial-layout** — `tabs` or `columns` with only 1 item; you probably want a different surface
- **empty-container** — `details` or `aside` with no nested sections
- **empty-callout** — `callout` with empty `text`; almost always means content was placed as a sibling and escapes the box (see "Empty-text callout" above)
- **undeclared-node** — `diagram.flow` edge with `from` or `to` referencing a node id not declared in the `nodes` array
